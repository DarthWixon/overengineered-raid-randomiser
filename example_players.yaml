# ban gnomes by default because I have taste - I was tempted to hardcode it.

# Structure:
# each player's preferences are delimited by ---
# the structure of each entry is:
# name: player name
# banned roles: ["role_1", "role_2"] - accepted values are "tank", "healer", if you try to ban DPS you'll break it
# banned_classes: ["class_1", "class_2"] - you can ban as many as you like, look in wowclasses.py for the spellings
# banned_races: ["race_1", "race_2"] - look in wowraces.py for the exact spellings, if you get them wrong it won't ban them
