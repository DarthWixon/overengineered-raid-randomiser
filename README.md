# Overengineered Raid Randomiser
This code is a massively overengineered way to generate
a random raid. I made it during meetings to do the MoP Rewind.

## Usage
All these instructions are \*nix based cos I don't have windows.
`git clone git@github.com:DarthWixon/overengineered-raid-randomiser.git`
`cd overengineered-raid-randomiser`
You can make a venv if you'd like. I assume you know how if you care.
`pip install -r reqs.txt`

Edit the `players.yaml` file to suit your raid.
Run with `python main.py`
